1,2022-11-06 13:40:40.470995,Katherine Y,Jul 2021,5.0,"Large, clean rooms in a central location in Chicago","First of all, like most reviews here indicated, the hotel has a very good location. It's directly next to the State/Lake ""L"" station, where many subway and bus lines go through, as well as only a few minutes walk away from other stations like Washington if you are trying to on the Blue Line. It's walkable to many famous Chicago attractions. Millennium Park where the ""Bean"" is was very close by.   Check-in was smooth. I did mobile check-in and needed to grab some keys from the front desk, and they were able to help with with promptness and a kind attitude. As with most Hilton hotels, I recommend downloading the Hilton app and doing mobile check-in since you get to personally pick your room on the app.   The room was much larger than I expected. We had the standard king room as well, so it wasn't the upgraded rooms. There was a kitchenette with a fridge, a microwave, and a sink. No dishes or utensils were provided tho, but I was just pleased there was a microwave in the room.   We also checked out the roof top bar. The views were very grand and it was nice sipping drinks as the sun sets. I'm not one for loud music (I thought it was one of those bars with a softer, quieter ambience) but it was still a nice experience overall.…",June 2021
2,2022-11-06 13:40:40.492546,gottagoohio,Oct 2022,4.0,Good Time,"PROS The location of this hotel is GREAT.  We were able to walk to most parks, museums restaurants, and shops.  Great Location but when we arrived there was construction right in front of the hotel so be aware, it doesn't look appealing.  The staff was all very nice and accommodating.  I don't remember seeing a business center if there was one.    The concierge was excellent at giving directions and places to go.  We arrived early so we were able to leave our bags and explore the city.  Such a great place with lots of cultures.   The rooftop club/lounge was awesome.  Even though they have a small menu the food was good and the atmosphere was great.    CONS There weren't many cons.  We stay at a lot of Hilton hotels but this was the first that didn't offer breakfast.  So instead of being able to run downstairs for coffee and a quick bite in the mornings, we were forced out to a breakfast spot which would cost us about $50.   Also, with dining out for every meal, we had leftovers we would bring back to the room that could have been great options for lunch the next day.  Unfortunately, there were no microwaves in the room nor in the hallways which meant we threw a lot of food away.  There are refrigerators, but no way to reheat food.  Not good. …",October 2022

4,2022-11-06 13:40:40.563577,retrorabbit66,Oct 2022,3.0,"For the price, you can do better","We stayed at theWit for a show at Chicago Theatre last weekend.  The hotel location was perfect for this and we enjoyed the views from our corner room overlooking the venue (902).  However, for the price we paid, the hotel was very underwhelming.  It felt like a tired, mid-priced business hotel but with high end pricing.  Everything about it felt like they were trying too hard to cater to the Instagram/influencer crowd going to the Roof bar while letting everything else in the hotel go.  We had the same experience as another reviewer of this room.  Furniture was scratched and scuffed, the side table by the couch had enough dust that I could visibly write ""unacceptable"" with my finger, and the water spots on the sink faucet at check in made it look like the room had been used and not cleaned (or not cleaned well).  The shower took forever for the water to get warm and the water pressure was low.    While I can overlook everything but the lack of cleanliness, what we got for what we paid was unacceptable.  This is our 3rd Hilton stay this year and definitely the worst by far.  We had a multi-room suite at the Conrad Indianapolis and paid less money for a much better experience.  We are returning to Chicago in early November for another show at Chicago Theatre and I held off on booking a room to see if we'd like to repeat a stay at theWit.  I actually got online while at the hotel and booked a stay elsewhere.  For the same price as theWit, you can stay at MUCH better places in the area.  If you just want pictures for the 'Gram, go to the bar instead of getting a room.…",October 2022

Due to an error on my part, the hotel sold out before I got a room. No problem... prepandemic TheWit was my favorite hotel. What I did not realize,  post pandemic,  this hotel seems to have lost its shine. Pulling up, no one was there to take my bags. No big deal. In to the lobby, checked in and got my cookie, ordered housekeeping, and was given room 902. This is a corner room with a tub at 550.00 a night. Total was $2500 dollars. This is equivalent to an all inclusive resort in Cancun. I am expecting something at this price point.  I open the door to blah and seemingly dirty. The carpet is gummy and needs a good shampoo or replaced. The furniture has seen better days. Water damage on the coffee table, the sofa was droopy, and the bathroom mirror was desilvering on one side. The towels and the bedding were scratchy instead of soft. The shower had zero water pressure. There was food on the side of the refrigerator. Even though I ordered housekeeping , I never received it. The effort of room service was annoying. You shoud be able to order on an app.  The good...the bed was comfortable with the exception of the sheets, the view was incredible,  and it was quiet for a room on State street. The bath products were great.   The hotel went from trendy and fun, to a cash exchange for a place to sleep. There was no experience beyond the cookie and a cookie, no matter how delightful, is just a cookie. I am sad to say I will not be back. There are too many choices to risk another bad experience…",October 2022

We chose to book the spa king rooms and expected relaxation and top tier service. However during our stay my husband was racially profiled by theWit's staff member. My sister and her wife (an interracial couple) walked in to the hotel before my husband and I and they were not asked to provide proof of stay. After valeting our car their staff member abruptly forced his arm out in front of my husband and I to ask for our room key.  My husband (6'4 Black male in a business suit)  showed his valet parking ticket. Then theWit staff member aggressively asked again for our room key. My husband pulled out his room card from his wallet and then theWit staff member looked at us and then stated ""It's policy procedure"". As we proceeded to go to the elevator two caucasian females dressed in club attire walked behind us to get onto the elevator without being carded.  The following morning I informed the front desk supervisor, Carrie,  and she immediately apologized and stated she will look into the incident.  She also provided food and beverage vouchers however we were leaving to the airport to go back home that morning. I am disgusted and extremely upset with the harassment from the staff member simply because of how we looked. We deserve the same treatment as everyone else!

Carrie was very pleasant and helpful from beginning to end. I arrived at theWit earlier than my room was ready, Carrie offered to have our bags held and gave suggestions on where we could visit until our room was ready. After an hour or so we came back to check on our room. I waited in line and when Carrie was done checking out the client in front of me she welcomed me. However, her pleasant greeting was quickly distracted by a rude customer asking questions about her bill after being helped by another front end staff.

Our room was clean and comfortable.  Interactions with staff were always pleasant.  Having stayed in two other Chicago hotels since July 2020, I can say that theWit is still by far an amazing value for the price.

As I was standing on the upstairs landing watching the lobby,I also heard the clerk yell across the lobby at the only lady in there sitting by herself in a corner, to put her mask on even though she was drinking her bottle of juice.

What’s more she checked on us during our stay to see if we needed anything, and always called us by name. She should be a Manager!

I am a diamond member with Hilton, so I stay with them quite frequently each year and I am very familiar with a wide range of their properties.  My second point for context is that I stayed at the hotel the weekend of Valentine’s day, so the restaurant not taking reservations, or the room options available are not being factored into this review as I understood those limitation when selecting the hotel.

My final point is that my stay was also in Chicago during the covid situation, so the lack of amenities is understandable and not weighed into this review.  With those points established, let me begin.  We arrived at the hotel at around 7 pm on Saturday.  It was busy given the…",February 2021

The decor is mildly dated, but the views from the upper floors are fantastic. Hilton Gold did not get us an upgrade, but were given waters and some snacks. The service was a little slow- they had not cleaned our room by 4pm. They were also unable to do late checkout, even though it is supposed to be part of the Gold benefits.

We picked this hotel based on it's ratings and it's location near the Chicago Theater - as we were attending a concert there that night. We were very pleased on both counts. The Chicago Theater is only a couple of buildings away. Great choice when you are returning to your room later at night.  I used Hilton Honors points to pay for the stay. I had used the Hilton app to check in and pick our room earlier in the day. The front desk staff was attentive and friendly - checking us into our room as soon as possible that afternoon.

Great location - walking distance from both office locations and tourist / shopping attraction. Hotel look and feel is pretty modern. Rooms are comfortable and very clean. One detail that I loved: They have birds chirping / nature sounds playing on the speakers in the rooms hallways (instead of music) - so it feels very relaxing when you walk out of your room and on to facing the challenges of the day, or when you come out of the elevator and on to your room after a busy day.

We picked this hotel based on it's ratings and it's location near the Chicago Theater - as we were attending a concert there that night. We were very pleased on both counts. The Chicago Theater is only a couple of buildings away. Great choice when you are returning to your room later at night.  I used Hilton Honors points to pay for the stay. I had used the Hilton app to check in and pick our room earlier in the day. The front desk staff was attentive and friendly - checking us into our room as soon as possible that afternoon.

Great location - walking distance from both office locations and tourist / shopping attraction. Hotel look and feel is pretty modern. Rooms are comfortable and very clean. One detail that I loved: They have birds chirping / nature sounds playing on the speakers in the rooms hallways (instead of music) - so it feels very relaxing when you walk out of your room and on to facing the challenges of the day, or when you come out of the elevator and on to your room after a busy day.

I'm talking about heavy chrome handles and knobs and faucet that scream ""quality"" the moment you walk into the room; I'm talking about walls and doors that are heavy enough to create a quiet sanctuary feel. Amazing built-ins in the closet that are functional--wish I had them in my own home, omg. Dark smooth wood, chrome, stone tile, tactile fabrics and upholstery, pops of color, oh my.

I brought my mom down for a birthday celebration.  We were able to check in to one room at 10 am and the other by 3 pm.  We were surprised with a corner room, which was a little larger than a normal king room.  It was really clean & had INCREDIBLE views of both Millenium park and the lake beyond.
