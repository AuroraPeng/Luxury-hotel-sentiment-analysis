Located within 10 minutes of anything you want.  Eateries are plentiful regardless of the flavor you're looking for.  This will definitely be a spot I'll be staying at in the future.",November 2022
1,2022-11-06 13:45:37.120243,R. Spencer,Aug 2021,5.0,Staff was great!,"I stayed at this hotel on 8/30/21 for one night. I arrived at 8:00pm and checked out at 6:30am. I did not spend much time here but the staff was really impressive from check-in, at weber grill, and check-out. The staff went out of their way to assist me. I had lots of questions since this was my first visit to this location and I really did appreciate them all for taking the time to explain and show me different things around the hotel. But, I would like to call out Richard Garling. Not only did he give me advise on how to catch a cab, this gentleman walked around from the front desk, went outside with me, and stepped into the street to flag a cab down that was a block away! Once the cab arrived, he placed my luggage in the back of the cab and told the cab driver where I was going. Now only if he would have paid the fair as well. LOL. Just kidding. Thank you Mr. Garling for going over and beyond the call of duty! It is very much appreciated.   The room was clean. The hot water did not take long to get hot, and it was super hot! Be careful with the hot water. The refrigerator in the room worked very well. My drinks were cold and my leftovers from Weber Grill had a little frost on the take out container.   Weber Grill - is located next to hotel. There is a door in the lobby that connects the two. So no need to go outside. The female and male hosts on 8/30/21 were great. I enjoyed talking with them while I waited from my takeout. Even though it was close to closing, I wasn't rushed and they the female host provided great conversation. She was very well versed over the menu and she had just started 4 days earlier. But her picks were delicious. Thank you!   There is also a pantry in the lobby were you can buy drinks and snacks. Much thanks for the front desk clerk that checked me in and showed me how to use the self check-out machine.…",August 2021

5,2022-11-06 13:45:37.197961,Mandy G,Oct 2022,5.0,Great Hotel in a Convenient Location,"We would definitely stay here again. The hotel was clean, the staff was friendly, and it was located in the middle of everything we were doing during our stay. We arrived about an hour before check-in, but our room was ready, so we were able to check-in early. The indoor pool was warm, and my daughter enjoyed swimming in it.  The only thing I wish I would have known ahead of time was the cost of parking. To park in the attached parking garage, it is $60/night, and it isn't come and go as you please. We parked and then walked or took an Uber wherever we needed to go for the duration of our stay.",October 2022

My wife and I stayed for two nights to catch a Cubs game.  We were not alone, as the place was teeming with fellow Cubs fans staying there to catch a game or two.  Very nice rooms, indoor pool, exercise room, and restaurant.  I would definitely go again.     Two minor, yet annoying, issues.  First, we arrived around 9:30 AM, as we had an early flight.  Most hotels will let you in to your room as soon as one becomes available. We understood we might need to store our luggage and walk around town for a number of hours.  However, we were told the “good news” was that a room was in fact available.  However, we would have to pay $20 to get in to it.  I found…",August 2019

I recommend getting a pass for the train rather than buying individual tickets. We also took the train from O Hare to the hotel and it dropped us off right at the door. The service at the hotel was great. The rooms however, are a little tired. Yes the air conditioner is noisy. Yes you can hear fire trucks and ambulances . It’s the big city! What did you expect?

The property is centrally located and close to everything, was clean from the lobby to our room, and the service was good except they didn't have any available rooms with two beds. None at all. Not even in suites, if they have them. So my college buddy and I slept together in a King sized bed, it would have been super awkward or impossible with anyone but a multi-decade very close friend.

I really appreciated the easy access to the Grand el station and ready walks to Michigan Avenue or way down to the lake. It's not a family hotel so I'd say it's more for singles, couples and maybe if you have older children. There is no hot pot/boiler in the room but there's a microwave and fridge. Amenities are very basic, just soap, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. The room is clean and doesn't look tired though. And all the accessibility makes up for that!

I called and was informed there was a garage literally next door to the hotel. This was a huge plus for us.  We were checked in by Nejron and everything went smoothly. He was polite and friendly.

Excellent place to stay for a family that wants a nice hotel when there is no budget for the Ritz. Across street from a Jewel and close to a Trader Joes.

It was Taste of Chicago that weekend, and there must have been some other things going on in the city. All of the hotels in the city were booking up, and the prices shot up to outrageous levels. I can't really blame this hotel for going along with that, but it was hard to stomach the amount I paid for what was far from a luxury hotel. Then again, I guess you pay for the great location, and they only did what the other hotels did regarding price.  If I look past that issue, though, it was fine.

The room was spacious, clean, and had a refrigerator and microwave, as well as a safe that fit all of my personal belongings. I had only one small issue with the hotel itself, but the staff had no control over this. The elevators are supposed to require a keycard to call to the bottom floor. I routinely used the elevators without my room key. I would feel a bit more secure if the elevator key card lock had worked…",December 2014

The hotel is right above the Red Line and right by shopping, dining, and other attractions. Every staff person we encountered was polite, professional, and smiling. The lobby is bright and modern with work stations and lounge seating. The Weber Grill restaurant is off the lobby.   The room was pretty spacious for a downtown hotel. One minor design quibble:  we both smacked our shins on the heavy wooden platform bed frames. The bathroom was roomy and pleasantly modern. A proper closet complete with a suitcase rack was nice.   We will be back!!",June 2015

Whether it's just my husband and me or with kids, it's never disappointed! We love the breakfast at Weber Grill (great for any meal, really.) The hotel staff -always excellent, the rooms are newly decorated. Can't beat the location. Just a block from an indoor mall that exits right onto Michigan Ave so it's great in the winter too!

Everyone was very helpful and willing to accommodate to our needs. Bedroom/bath were pretty typical, although our view was definitely above average! We were surprised we could hear so much street noise on the 23rd floor...many sirens, people yelling as they exited bars and more. We chose the self-park because it was the best price in the city. We were later disappointed to learn that it was not in and out parking. We wanted to stay on-budget so kept our car parked! That was a bit disappointing. Overall...good hotel!",June 2015

It is a very convenient location, not only in the city, but sitting on top of a Red Line subway stop. It's fairly simple (one connection) from the airport subway, to come in from O'Hare and there is much to do within a short walk.  The Merchandise Mart, Navy Pier, major architectural landmarks and Michigan Avenue shopping are all nearby.  Check-in: I'd checked in online the night before, a nice feature from Hilton. Though the room wasn't ready when I arrived, I was offered a room that was prepared to go, but opted to hold out for the top floor room I'd requested.

We stayed on a Friday night and spent the two days in Chicago.  The hotel is located near the River a couple blocks off Michigan Avenue.  The location is perfect.  It is near the bar and restaurant section but not far from the shopping hub. I requested a room high up and was put on floor 22.  I also requested a room with a view of the city and it did not disappoint.  The beds were comfy and room was very clean.  The decor was new and modern and included a frig, Kuerig and safe if needed.  They offered an easy checkout process via the phone.  This was the first time that we stayed downtown Chicago and would chose this hotel again!",December 2014

This is better for a few reasons. Nicer, larger rooms and a fabulous restaurant attached to hotel where you also get your included breakfast. The Weber Grill is independent but there's an arrangement for the hotel breakfasts. Food is so good here, some of my colleagues and I had dinner here as well. Not fine dining but not casual dining either. Great food, although the steaks were sometimes cooked more than how they were ordered.   No complaints about room except for the lack of a hand-held shower. Staff were friendly and there was some nice apple cider and cookies late afternoon and evening. Jazz and Blues clubs and several restaurants as well as downtown office buildings within…",December 2014

From the time we pulled up, the valet (gentleman) was very nice and welcoming. We did not valet, but I wanted to just to tip him. I will warn you that true to form...parking in Chicago is expensive. It was $61.00 to valet and $45.00 to self-park. Self-parking was not bad at all. It was easy in and easy out and just an elevator ride in to the hotel lobby. The staff was very nice on arrival and checking out. Unlike NYC, our room was HUGE. We had the 14th floor and it was a wonderful view. Chicago is a beautiful city, especially during Christmas.

The hotel is literally steps from the red line train in one direction and 2 blocks from the Magnificent Mile shopping in the other. You can walk to the Art Institute in 15-20 min. while passing Millennium Park. Water pressure in the shower is too low for me but the beds are very comfortable. You must remember that you are in a city, so you will hear sirens and traffic occasionally during the night. There is a Keurig in the room. Only problem with that was even though we brewed tea, it tasted like coffee. There were even grinds in the bottom of the cup.…",March 2014

I was pleasantly surprised by the very reasonable rate and very pleased with the property.  It's been recently remodeled so everything is still relatively new.

We didn't know ANYONE in Chicago, so we relied on our hotel location to place us centrally in the heart of the mix. The staff is SUPERB! Our reservation agent HANS was a stellar example of customer service. He gave us extra deals and had NO problem going above and beyond what was required of him. He REALLY made our stay exceptional.

They were very friendly and helpful with any questions we had.  Things we liked or found helpful about the room was the in room safe, very nice hair dryer not connected to the wall (even had a diffuser), refrigerator, and microwave.

We could still hear the noise in this room but it ended within the hour.  It must have been due to a work crew on the floor above ours because we did not hear it again during our stay.  We stayed in room 1424, a king room.  The bed was very comfortable and the side chair and ottoman were a nice touch.

Perfect location on the Red Line CTA, and right in the middle of great shopping and dining. One odd thing is floors 2-11 are ""missing,"" that is, the elevator goes directly from floor 1 to 12. I stayed on floor 14, and it really was that high up, so I don't now what is going on in those other floors.

It takes about 12 minutes to walk to the Chicago Art Institute. HH members get free bottle of water and a warm welcome. Rooms are nice although not new. They offer a bed adjustment system but I was not impressed as the matress was too soft regardless. In the morning there is complimentary coffee and same in evening or you can have a fill breakfast at the Webber Grill Bar. Wi Fi is free. Ask for a high floor as you can hear the traffic from below.,December 2013
2099,2022-11-06 13:50:06.351265,Mark B,Dec 2013,4.0,Nice Enough,"I've stayed at Hilton Gardens all over, and I'd rank this one highly for friendly service. Perfect location on the Red Line CTA, and right in the middle of great shopping and dining. One odd thing is floors 2-11 are ""missing,"" that is, the elevator goes directly from floor 1 to 12. I stayed on floor 14, and it really was that high up, so I don't now what is going on in those other floors. I would recommend the highest a floor you can get, since even on floor 14 I could hear the sirens on Saturday night. Like some other Hilton Gardens, it had a Keurig coffee maker in the room, which is nice. The associated restaurant (Weber Grill) can get quite crowded, but that is not a big issue since there are tons of other restaurant choices within easy walking distance. One hint for those…",December 2013

I must say I have stayed at a number of Hilton Garden Inns on the west coast and found them all average at best.  Not the case here.  Our check in was quick and flawless and took less than two minutes (we had reservations).  Our room was very clean and appointed well.  When we returned to the room the next afternoon after seeing some sites, we found a note from our maid hoping we were having a good time.  The second night we got in late and I grabbed 2 water bottles from a little store next to the front desk.  When I tried to pay for them, the clerk said don't worry about it.  We asked for recommendations and directions a couple of times and found the staff very helpful.  Overall a very good stay and, if I might add,…",October 2013

After reading it's proximity to the red line subway and the Mag Mile we booked it, the Front Desk Agent Hans was so very helpful calling us when our room was ready and giving us great breakfast recommendations. Mary's Cafe (a small diner just down Grand Ave past the Mag Mile)    Our room was 1736 and we had a NorthEast View overlooking a neat dome building, Bloomingdale's. The room was spacious, clean and the empty mini fridge was a great bonus for keeping water and snacks in.

If you are taking advantage of the Chicago ""L"" system from O' Hare or Midway Airports, the RED line stop for Grand Ave. is directly across the street, which is so convenient! When leaving on the RED line just walk a few hundred feet and your on your way! You are within walking distance of literally hundreds of dining options, incredible shopping and many, many great bars. Navy Pier is just a 20 min. walk right down Grand Ave. If you enjoy theater, many great choices are very nearby. In my opinion the Shedd Aquarium is a must! For sky-high views there are the Sears Tower and John Hancock Tower. The Chicago Hilton Garden Inn Downtown is the perfect start point for these and lots of other great things to do while in Chicago!",September 2013

Lollapalooza was going on the week-end were there and staff took particular care to note that rowdy behavior would not be tolerated and that extra security had been hired.

Rooms were comfy but furnishings a little dated.  It was very convenient having a fridge in the room.  The pool area is tiny and was very crowded, but still enjoyable.  We found the air in the pool area to be stale - we all started coughing as soon as we entered the room, but there were sliding glass doors to let in fresh air.  Our only complaint was the noise from outside - sirens from ambulances/police every few minutes at night time - but this is outside of the hotel's control.

The breakfast is served in the Weber Grill restaurant and the server was great. Breakfast is included, which is for me is one of the biggest benefits from the HHonors program.   The location is excellent, very close to the sites and shopping area.",May 2011

Hotel is conveniently located across the road from the metro meaning we were able to catch the train directly to our hotel and save on cab fares.  The room was a good size and is within walking distance of Michigan Ave/Mag Mile and there  are also bus stops around the corner.  There is a good choice of both restaurants and shopping nearby.  Our only negative comment was that we were not able to check in when we arrived at 1pm.  We were however checked in by around 3.30pm.  Being a HGI we would have expected that they serve breakfast but they did not.,December 2010

The location is great: a two minute walk to the Mile, and a redline CTA stop to your immediate right as you step out of the hotel front door.    The staff was also great: we had missed room cleaning one day (left the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign up too long) and asked one of the maids to exchange our dirty towels for clean ones.  She did this AND quickly gave our room a once over.  The desk staff are knowledgeable, helpful, and honest (when we asked where to purchase an umbrella, the response was: ""WE sell them for $10....but there's an Osco across the street"").

Our son wanted to eat at The Cheesecake Factory for his birthday dinner and Magda provided us with a map and directions on getting there.

Staff was extremely courteous and helpful.  They made very good recommendations for dining and transportation.  We had a fantastic north facing view which included Hancock tower. The rooms were a little on the small side for 2 people with 2 beds.

We arrived in the early afternoon and our room wasn't ready.  Check in was at 3pm, so that was fine.  They held our bags and we did some sightseeing.  Returned to the hotel and our room was ready.  On first entering our room which was 1711 there was a slight odor.  Not bad or anything.  Then when I went into the bathroom, there was a mildewy smell.  I really hate that smell.  But it wasn't so bad to ask for a room change.  There is no fan in the bathroom and with no air circulation, the mildewy smell is going to occur.  So those are some things that bugged me.

I had a mixed experience with the hotels in New York and Vegas, however, found the Hilton Garden Inn to be fantastic.   The staff were very helpful from the moment we arrived until we checked out.  We stayed for three days and I was overwhelmed by the friendliess we recieved.    The Webber Grill is a great restaurant with good old American sized porrtions and a large selection to choose from.   Also the hotel bar had informal and friendly staff who were up for a laugh and once again couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome.  The Hotel is located beside the magnificent mile and is therefore great for this who love to shop…",July 2005

Staff was extremely helpful and was very good at giving us different restaurant ideas.  Having been to Chicago numerous times, it was nice to get different ideas and having them pan out. Rooms were clean and had everything you would need.  Not spectacular rooms, but very nice.",July 2005

Every hotel employee was very friendly and the service was very good. The room was large, very clean and well appointed. There was a refrigerator, microwave and free high-speed internet access. The blanket was sandwiched between two sets of sheet, which was a nice touch. Also, while the hotel was full I found that at most I had to wait a minute for one of the elevators, a fact I really appreciated. The location is excellent - within two blocks of the magnificent mile, half mile from navy pier, mile from the Art Institute, near public transportation and surrounded by restaurants. The area also felt very safe even late at night. The only area that could use minor improvements was house-keeping. The last…",June 2005

Mile and Museum, Art Institute, Aquarium, and Planetarium.  All are within walking distance The staff was very accomodating and allowed us to check in early and leave our luggage on check out to do some shopping. The breakfast buffet was terrific, but could use more fresh fruits.   The only mild downer was the in-room air conditioner which was occasionally noisy at night. Would definitely stay there again and I'd give it a solid 3-3 1/2 stars. Galoha",June 2005

The staff were extremely pleasant  and friendly at all times and the whole hotel seems brand new and clean. The free internet access from all rooms is a huge bonus,as is the fridge in the room. The only small problem we had was that you had to run the hot tap for about 5 minutes until the hot water came for the shower.But  I think this was more to do with the location of our room at the end of a long corridor with no adjoining rooms.

What a great experience we had!  The room was clean, the staff was extremely friendly and the location couldn't be beat.  We got the internet rate of $109 which was a deal.  It was great having a small refrigerator in the room for drinks (microwave too, although we didn't use it) .  There's a great grocery store just across the street.  The kids enjoyed swimming in the indoor pool--despite it's small size, it was perfect for them.  We ate dinner at the Weber Grill and it was teriffic.  Not one complaint about this hotel; I would highly recommend it to anyone!",March 2005

The staff was wonderful from the moment we checked in until we left...this included the valet at the door, the porter, the front desk staff and the maids.  Everyone was friendly and went out of their way to make us feel at home.  The room was average size and very clean.  We were in room 2203 on the Hilton Honors floor (the hotel has 23 floors).  Our room was far from the elevator and very quiet.  We had a view of the Sears Tower...which our boys loved.  Our 8 and 9 year old boys swam in the pool (indoors).  The pool is a ""play""pool and only 4 feet deep and not huge.  It was never crowded and they had a great time.  The spa held 5 people max.  Although not used the workout room…",January 2005

The guest service and valet staff was friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating.  Our guest room was incredibly clean, at a comfortable temperature and even had a decent view, for being surrounded by high rises.  We bugged the front desk staff multiple times for directions, locations of attractions, recommendations, etc.  Every time they were just as happy to help as if it were our first question.  Our do not disturb sign was on from check in to check out and we were not disturbed once!  In my experience with past stays at other hotels throughout the years, a do not disturb sign still means we can be bothered about towels and such.  It was a pleasure to have the…",
