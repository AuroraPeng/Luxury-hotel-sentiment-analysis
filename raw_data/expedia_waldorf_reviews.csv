10,2022-11-06 17:04:13.492409,5/5 Excellent,"Ameil, New Rochelle","Jul 15, 2022",,"What can I say? It’s the Waldorf.  I love it here; it’s out go to hotel In Chicago- the amenities (spa) the staff the attention to detail-
Really top quality. The restaurant serves a lovely brunch that is delicious.  Went for 1 night - stayed for 2. Check it out!  Its great for a girls weekend- and alone trip or spending time with someone special"
11,2022-11-06 17:04:13.503222,5/5 Excellent,Vince,"Jun 15, 2022",,Great stay
12,2022-11-06 17:04:13.513746,3/5 Okay,"Marianna, Glendale","Jun 2, 2022",,"The location of the hotel is very nice, walkable to pretty much everywhere you want to be, a nice stroll of 15 minutes gets you to River Walk, 5 minutes walk and you find yourself on the Magnificent Mile or the Hancock tower. That being said, the hotel itself could deliver a better experience for a luxury hotel it claims to be. It lacks normal lobby, has a restaurant that closes at a quite early hour and yet the room service was not available the day we arrived because ""a lot of people called off""... Also there was a distinct unpleasant smell in the room that we brought up with the hotel, and no one followed up on the issue. The front desk lady never informed us at the check in, that the hotel provides complimentary transportation service to its guests for trips within 1 mile radius of the hotel, which pretty much was everywhere we went throughout our stay and often times got a cab or an uber to do so. 
The restaurant of the hotel ""The Brasserie"" is very nice, they serve delicious breakfast and have live music on the weekends which was a very nice touch. Overall the hotel is clean and quite well maintained, however it does not have the sense of luxury that Waldorf is supposed to give. I would probably not select it next time I'm in Chicago."

We were given a card for free bar items as a sort of apology, but when we gave this to the host upon arrival for brunch (to redeem) she forgot and never came back. We didn’t care to remind her, and overall brunch service was very slow. We had a good time just because this was our Valentine’s Day getaway and we were determined to, but otherwise pretty disappointing. The hotel itself is beautiful, but service did not match expectations."

I was also really disappointed to find that they'd closed the previous, cool, smaller, darker bar and that now the option for a drink is the restaurant, which isn't what we wanted for an after dinner drink.

601,2022-11-06 17:04:43.003745,5/5 Excellent,Verified traveler,"Dec 11, 2017",,We come into city every year in December for Christmas shopping and to see a play.  The hotel is in a great location and we enjoy the small setting without a lot of people. The staff is very helpful and the rooms are very nice.  This was our second time at the Waldorf and we will be back next year.
602,2022-11-06 17:04:43.022860,5/5 Excellent,Verified traveler,"Dec 11, 2017",Best Hotel in Chicago,"I was born and raised in Chicago but moved to NYC after college. I now return to The Windy City every month for about 2-5 days for business. I only stay at the Waldorf. From the consistent high quality service, comfortable beds, well- maintained rooms, delicious breakfast, desireable location and all the comforts of home for the business traveler, this is the place for me! I've tried the Four Seasons and Penunsula- didn't live up to the same level for me."

Hotel has a modern chic feel; but feels comfortably intimate and cozy.  Rooms are lovely with great attention to detail..  Views fantastic.  I had a room with terrace and gas fireplace.  Great French patisserie coffee cafe in lobby.  Margeaux restaurant upstairs is a Parisien upscale bistro iand a new  neighborhood favorite.

I was taking myself on a I've in a lifetime special trip after a horrible year and this hotel did not disappoint.   They were even more amazing when they found out I had,  gotten my purse stolen by assisting me with phone calls,  faxing paperwork  and sending a complimentary glass of wine.   I  cannot say enough good things about my stay."

Good size rooms, huge bathrooms.  polite & friendly staff. House car is great service they are offering. Downsides The mattresses are not firm and not very comfortable changed rooms and still the same. Rooms clean but more attention needs to be given to dusting specially mini bar.

The staff are very nice, polite, accommodating and helpful. The hotel is within walking distance to great shopping and restaurants. Suite was beautifully decorated, extremely comfortable and very clean. I loved my stay at this hotel and would definitely stay here again."
610,2022-11-06 17:04:43.257837,4/5 Good,Verified traveler,"Dec 14, 2017","A nice hotel, but","The Waldorf Astoria is a nice hotel--however it is not on par with the Peninsula or the Ritz Carlton in  Chicago. There basically is no lobby and the entry  into the hotel leaves something to be desired/.  The room did have a fireplace which was quite nice in the cold weather; however the room  was very dimly lit ,particularly the bathroom.  The bathroom also only had one sink.  There was no coffee maker in the room--but when we requested one it was promptly delivered.  These are all little things, of course but when taken in aggregate it makes me feel that this hotel is not on the level of the Peninsula in Chicago or the Ritz Carlton in Chicago

Needless to say it was a hectic and stressful time.  Travelling with my two daughters aged 18 years and under 2 also added to the challenge of finding a spot that was both comfortable and functional.  The Waldorf Astoria Chicago was everything and more.  The fitness centre was bright cheerful and fully equipped to satisfy my older daughter and my work out needs and the pool was a special place to share time with my toddler.  The restaurant staff were always helpful and attentive, keeping the pace moving so there were no melt downs or disturbances to other patrons.  The Doormen were most helpful in obtaining vehicles as needed and assisted with the loading of a tricky stroller always with a smile.  The housekeeping staff had a keen sense of how many towels and toilet articles to leave from the first day and the complimentary turn down service was a real treat.

Needless to say it was a hectic and stressful time.  Travelling with my two daughters aged 18 years and under 2 also added to the challenge of finding a spot that was both comfortable and functional.  The Waldorf Astoria Chicago was everything and more.  The fitness centre was bright cheerful and fully equipped to satisfy my older daughter and my work out needs and the pool was a special place to share time with my toddler.  The restaurant staff were always helpful and attentive, keeping the pace moving so there were no melt downs or disturbances to other patrons.  The Doormen were most helpful in obtaining vehicles as needed and assisted with the loading of a tricky stroller always with a smile.  The housekeeping staff had a keen sense of how many towels and toilet articles to leave from the first day and the complimentary turn down service was a real treat.  
Our trip to Chicago could not have been better thanks to all the staff at the Waldorf.  I will look forward to staying there again in the future."

We got great dinner suggestions as well and they made reservations for us which were perfect. Cold champagne room service was right on time and delicious to start our evening in Chicago.
Visited the spa prior to dinner for complimentary sauna, steam, jaquzzi and all amenties. Only suggestion for the spa - a nice scent in the women's steam room would be nice - it smelled musty. Also have experinced in other saunas a cinnnamin scent - adds a nice touch. Noticed also in the women's showers that the exhaust fan grill was caked with dust - recommend cleaning them more often.
Next day we order a quick coffee room service - again was on time and the coffee was spectacular. We attended a Notre Dame game in Indiana, again water, warm car etc. was a nice suprise. Arrival late (11PM) from ND and were met with smiles and again no problems.

Looks expensive, but many of the silver looking room fixtures are in reality plastic. Tub drain did not work. Fireplace did not work; pilot light out. Both repaired, but really both should have been picked up beforehand for a hotel of this quality and price."
958,2022-11-06 17:04:55.715800,5/5 Excellent,A DeLany,"Oct 23, 2013",Whirlwind Weekend,"We arrived at the hotel early and the kind professional staff stored our bags while we toured Chicago until our room was ready. They called us promptly one hour later to let us know our room was waitng for us. Great vallet service as well - the car was warm when we got in. We got great dinner suggestions as well and they made reservations for us which were perfect. Cold champagne room service was right on time and delicious to start our evening in Chicago.
Visited the spa prior to dinner for complimentary sauna, steam, jaquzzi and all amenties. Only suggestion for the spa - a nice scent in the women's steam room would be nice - it smelled musty. Also have experinced in other saunas a cinnnamin scent - adds a nice touch. Noticed also in the women's showers that the exhaust fan grill was caked with dust - recommend cleaning them more often.
Next day we order a quick coffee room service - again was on time and the coffee was spectacular. We attended a Notre Dame game in Indiana, again water, warm car etc. was a nice suprise. Arrival late (11PM) from ND and were met with smiles and again no problems.
All in all our suite was beautiful and clean, spacious and romantic. Would love to visit again in a heartbeat !"
