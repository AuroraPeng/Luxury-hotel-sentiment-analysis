0,2022-11-06 17:21:58.248644,4/5 Good,Amy Kimie,"Nov 4, 2022",,"The location was a strong point and recognizable brand hotel.  I was able to walk to all of the areas  I wanted to see.  Amenities in the room were basic, had to ask for a shower cap and an extra blanket.  Staff was helpful when I asked for help, etc.  I was a solo woman visitor so this hit all my basic needs."

Other than that the staff was nice, the hotel is near a busy Wacker Drive and Michigan Avenue, so there are plenty of places where you can eat, shop, people watch, etc. and is near public transportation."

Most places we could easily walk to, and places that needed an Uber ride were max of 10 minutes away. It was right on the riverwalk, and Michigan Ave was a block away. The room was comfortable too.

The cleaning staff is a different story and I blame the supervisor the most.  We were in room 1906, we had a late checkout at 1:00pm.  When we brought the luggage carts up to load everything we still had an hour till checkout.  Well the supervisor assumed because he saw us with the carts we had left the room & told he cleaner.  So we were taking a nap before getting on a 22 hour train ride back to the east coast.  She knocked not only waking us back the knock but walked into the room too.  Thank goodness it wasn't one of the times my husband decided to strip down.

The room was small and made even smaller by all the luggage we had for the trip, see we had been in Chicago for 10 days total due to my husband's work convention.  They do not have chair height toilets which because of how small the bathroom was made it very difficult for me to get up.   

Then there was the laundry room.  It has one washer and dryer it was very clean & safe as you had to have your room key to get in.  The washer did a great job the dryer not so much.  After spending $ 13 dollars anything made of cotton was still wet & I had to hang in our already small over filled room.  I will say when I went to the front desk they did refund $10.

The location was very central to everything downtown by either walking or bus.

If you are going make sure you get your parking in advance and park at millenium garage Grant Park North and save yourself at least 50% off your parking.

My experience was not gr8 as I arrived at 2:30 pm for 4 pm check-in time and was charged $25 extra which surprised me because most hotels will let you check in a little early without any extra charge.
 On the day of check out I was locked out of my room because the door lock was broke and had to be reprogrammed. No engineer on site and maintenance man needed several tries to unlock my door. I was out for about 45 mins, glad did not miss my flight. 
Also restaurant onsite is closed right now. So no food in the hotel."

Our son was staying there for 4 nights and we had paid upfront in full via website and on check in they asked for a $30 per night deposit. Which we were not aware of. So he paid them in cash deposit via a card. He had asked for a late check out to which they said YES sure at no extra cost. hotel occupancy  was low so this was granted To this day he still has not received his deposit back to him after being told by hotel manager that it would be. I am guessing since he was a young man they thought they would just brush him off. Well I am disgusted at the way the hotel staff have treated him. Yes I am sure the will response with a generic response with some excuse to excuse themself for their disgusting behavior towards him and with no refund of his deposit

1376,2022-11-06 17:23:14.582254,2/5 Poor,Verified traveler,"Nov 29, 2021",味もそっけもないホテル,ヒルトン系であるため、ベッドやタオル類の設備はそれなりのものを使用している。ただ、チェックイン時は、フロントの二人が自分たちの会話を優先し、待たせる始末。また、フロントにはサービスのコーヒーもなく、朝食用のレストランも軽食程度をイメージさせる雰囲気でした。周辺は繁華街であり、寝るだけと考えればそれなりの評価です。ただ、下の方の階であれば、少し騒々しいと感じるかもしれません。
