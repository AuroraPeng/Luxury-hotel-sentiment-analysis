Having just visited the Waldorf location in Monarch Beach this summer, which was fabulous, I was really disappointed with my Chicago visit. The hotel was very expensive, on par with Four Seasons and the Langham. Waldorf doesn’t compare to either though…   The rooms are simple and underwhelming. Service is ok.  There is no area to “chill” other than the small, cramped lobby and bar.   The dining sucked.  Our first night for dinner, we had a variety of food on the menu and honestly, nothing was very good. Chicken was ok, onion soup was average at best…   They wouldn’t allow us into the dining room for breakfast today, because there was a convention there, even though I am a paying guest. I had to leave the hotel this morning, in the rain, to eat breakfast. Not five star service…  The spa is nice, and very attentive staff, that’s why I’m giving two stars. I’ve stayed at three other Waldorf a, they were all much better than this one.   For $700 a night, go to Four Seasons. It’s beautiful, fantastic food, and impeccable service…   …",October 2022

5,2022-11-06 13:35:31.817355,Mark Y,Oct 2022,3.0,Underwhelming Experience,"I got the opportunity to spend the night at the Waldorf Chicago (WA) in early September.  I had some expectations, but overall I tend to be a pretty low maintenance guest.  Just do your job, go through my benefits for my particular status, and just be pleasant.  I can say that this property completely underwhelmed me.  There was a wait during check-in, but that wasn't too big of a deal since the property was likely understaffed (I get this).  It was an average check-in experience, however the front desk professional didn't even bother to give me an idea of what my benefits were as a Hilton Diamond member.  Unfortunately, she just didn't seem too interested in being there.    The Good:  Room was a good size and the AC worked amazingly well.  I slept pretty well, so no complaints there.  I ordered room service the next morning, and it was delivered promptly.  The food was as expected - good.  The room service attendant was really pleasant, and it was an easy process.    The Bad:  Other than housekeeping and room service, I found the rest of the staff very marginal at best.  Again, all I really expect is to have a friendly encounter and not have them look at the ground with passing.  I also noticed that I was not offered assistance with bags upon check-in.  I probably would've declined since I only had two small bags, but I find it paramount for a hotel that has the reputation as the WA to offer guests assistance automatically.   I did the checkout through the Hilton app since I didn't want to deal with the hoopla at the desk.  Upon looking at my folio, I noticed that the property failed to deduct the Diamond benefit of the breakfast credit.  It did get cleared up by a really nice gentleman (wish I remembered his name), so I really appreciated that.    I stayed not too long ago at the Peninsula in Chicago, and the WA isn't even close to being in the same league as the Peninsula.  I've had much better experiences at the Garden Inn properties than here.  After traveling along the Pacific Rim for the past two weeks, it became even more apparent how mediocre the staff and the experience is at the WA in comparison to luxury properties in Asia and Australia.  The property has a lot of potential, and hopefully they'll be able to improve on their service because I would surly be open to staying there in the future.  …",September 2022

It was without a doubt the best weeekend trip we have ever taken. The service was unbeatable. We were checked into our rooms immediately. Our bags were brought up for us from our car.  The staff that brought us our bags was knowledgeable and helpful.  Each evening our room was turned down and freshened up.  In one instance I had left my glasses out on the nightstand and when we returned from dinner there was a new cleaning cloth laid under my glasses.

Sadly there was only one small window with a view of a parking garage, no late check out available and the shower flooded the bathroom. No in-room coffee machine either, the free tea/coffee delivery to the room does not work well if you try and get it at 8am.  Room was super clean, staff were amazing, the bed very comfortable and the fire place a nice touch (though it was August). Would I stay here again? Not for $690/night. It is a decent luxury hotel, but it is not the above and beyond luxury I would expect for that price.",August 2022

I emailed back and two days later someone else on the team replied back.  Checked into hotel. Room is cute. Definitely not a hotel that is friendly to the rainbow clientele. Don’t get the best treatment and I’m a Hilton diamond. I had added a second reservation to extend my stay. In the morning I had told the front desk person and they switched out my keys and gave me a new pair. Got back to the hotel and the keys didn’t work.

It's my favorite hotel in Chicago!  This property resembles a condominium residence as oppose to a hotel.  For me, it's home away from home.  The suites are spectacular.  I would recommend upgrading to a suite.  It feels like PARIS in Chicago.  OMG! I don't know which I enjoy most, the soaking tub, the bed, sitting in front of the fireplace or having breakfast on the terrace.  Oh and I must say, the food at the hotel restaurant is delicious. The icing on the cake is the spa and pool.  I never leave the property without getting a message and going into the steam room.

Obviously, with the Waldorf, you have high expectations, and this hotel did not disappoint. Elegant, well appointed, very clean and a great location. However, what truly sets this hotel apart is the customer service. We arrived early, due to our flight schedule, and they were able to give us an immediate check in. That was greatly appreciated as we were exhausted from our flight. Likewise, on the day of departure, we were given a late checkout due to our flight. Again, appreciated!

We did not book any spa treatments, but thoroughly enjoyed all of the amenities.  The staff were very friendly and attentive and we enjoyed our time in the spa area.  We had a deluxe Queen and the room was nice, but I am glad that we were using points rather than paying full price as there was nothing special about the room, other than the bathroom.  The deep tub was amazing and very much enjoyed.  After reading many reviews here about the amazing service and attention to detail, I have to say that we were underwhelmed.

The Waldorf Astoria is supposedly a 5 star hotel but I've honestly had less issues at a motel 6. We checked in and were told our room number and given the keys. We arrived to the room to find an extra television on the floor leaning against a wall. It was a little strange but we double checked our room keys and we were in the right room. To be honest I was slightly disappointed by the shabby furniture and the paint stained curtains. Also the tv (the one mounted) did not work. We were in the room for about 30 minutes before someone walked into our room and asked what we were doing there??

Upon arrival, everything was stellar-- from the valet, to the front desk, to housekeeping. At check-in, we were upgraded to a beautiful suite with a terrace. That night, in order to make our dinner reservation, the valet offered to give us a quick lift to dinner when Uber was taking longer than we anticipated.  Housekeeping was very friendly and sweet.

On this visit, we arrived in the early evening at the time we had informed the concierge. When I went to the counter to check in, the sole person at the front desk was on the phone, and I stood there for five minutes while she finished a phone call. There were other front desk staff in an adjacent room, I’m not sure why they didn’t come to the desk. It wasn’t the greatest welcome. We are very particular about our room (one of the reasons we stay here) and the concierge was ultimately helpful finding a room that would be suitable, but it took some work.

The hotel unexpectedly upgraded us to a larger suite which was a wonderful surprise! They also left chocolate-covered strawberries and a note for us which were wonderful personal touches!  We had our baby with us and when they brought up the crib they also brought a diaper genie without us asking for it which was also a really nice touch.  The only reason we didn't give the stay a five star review was that we had a few small hiccups...we were charged over $30 for the mini bar although we only consumed one small bottle of soda.

What happened to this place?  Where to start?  Our refrigerator didn't work.  So they brought up a dusty, scratched-up, gross portable refrigerator for us to plug in.   Many surfaces were dusty - they claim to be sterilizing this place, but yeah - nope.  We got a room with a fireplace like we had last time.  Apparently they shut off the gas to every room, so the fireplace was non-functional.  Our balcony was among the larger ones in the hotel.  It didn't not have a table to set anything on.

The positives for the hotel: great location near waterfront and lots of restaurants room was clean.  The hotel has a large turnaround driveway that allows you to be picked up/dropped off without being on the main street in front.  The negatives: This is not a 5 star hotel.  It is a nice, clean Hilton; nothing more.  Hotel staff are almost non existent.  Only 1 person behind the reception desk.  No concierge in lobby.  Our room was not cleaned one morning so we called the front desk and were told the cleaning staff were gone for the day.

Second, it’s Christmas time.  The lobby was not decorated.  They did have a magnificent tree in the driveway but nothing inside.  I would expect much more from a hotel of this caliber.    Third, the pillows and sheets are not comfortable.  Pillows are hard and the sheets are not soft.  Who goes to a nice hotel to sleep on hard pillows and rough sheets?

Feel free to make up your own mind if the following is something you find important, but I’ve stayed at cheaper properties with less brand cache where none of the following cropped up as issues.   The mattress was decidedly ordinary (read: hard) and the bedding felt like it was starched - really rough and unpleasant to the touch.

However, when I tried to bring my fiance to the Waldorf this past weekend to share with her ultimate relaxation, the experience was... average. First off, the sauna, that once allowed patrons to enter in a new world with lavender aromatherapy, smells like a sweaty gym sock. Next was the jacuzzi. Out of service in men's and women's locker rooms for 4 months? Really? In the women's locker room services were overbooked so there was no room to ""relax"" in the so called relaxation room. the massage was great. Overall a large step down in what I thought was one of the best spas.",May 2018

The on site dining room leaves something to be desired but why would you want to eat at the hotel anyway with so many great dining experiences within walking distance?

Hilton gold room upgrade was provided.     Upgrade to the deluxe king room.  The room had a balcony with an East facing view.  Room was nice but lacked amenities of the standard king room.  Particularly the small bar area.  Where the standard room has counter top and a small bar sink this room only had a bar shelf.  The bathroom also lacked the TV in the mirror that the other rooms have.   Neither were deal breakers and in the summer the balcony makes up for these minor shortcomings.

Less than two blocks from Michigan Avenue, Rush Street and Oak Street, the Waldorf still manages to make you feel like you are alone in the world.  The service is as excellent as you would expect from a Waldorf Astoria as well. The on site dining room leaves something to be desired but why would you want to eat at the hotel anyway with so many great dining experiences within walking distance?

Hilton gold room upgrade was provided.     Upgrade to the deluxe king room.  The room had a balcony with an East facing view.  Room was nice but lacked amenities of the standard king room.  Particularly the small bar area.  Where the standard room has counter top and a small bar sink this room only had a bar shelf.  The bathroom also lacked the TV in the mirror that the other rooms have.   Neither were deal breakers and in the summer the balcony makes up for these minor shortcomings.  For winter visits though I will look for a grand deluxe king or higher tier too.     Spa amenities were excellent as usual.",July 2017

Bearing that in mind, I am always looking for those extra touches that either reward Diamond level status if a hotel is within the Hilton group (as is the Waldorf) or something to make one feel more welcomed, if it's a different brand.  The offer a free water or 15 percent off at their restaurant doesn't quite cut it.  Although the room was beautiful and the staff themselves very attentive and pleasant, one can find that very same hotel quality and staff attentiveness from a half a dozen or more hotels in the same vicinity along with the ""something extra"" for much less expense.

Everything that I planned went off without a hitch except for the the parts that included the Waldorf. Very disappointing for the reputation and amount of money you spend for their 'service'! The fireplace in our fireplace suite didn't even work!,July 2016

Our room was well-appointed and pleasantly furnished, however the bathroom mirror had a crack. The service was disappointedly slow both for room service and other requests. The elevator doors looked like they needed a good cleaning. Overall, we would have expected a little more attention to detail and better service. For the same price range there are several other better hotel options in the area.",May 2016

Room was beautiful with an incredible view. Great workout room, doormen. We had to ask three times to get a crib, and had to ask both nights for sheets for the pullout.  Perhaps that makes sense the first night, but housekeeping was on notice for the second night.   Also, the furnishings were in need of upgrades.  Mattress on the king bed was slanted and made it feel like I was sliding out of bed.  The furniture looked a bit threadbare. I would stay there again.  Such a good location.  A few improvements and this will be top notch!",July 2016

The service remains top-notch, with immediate greetings and service in all areas.   We had two problems with our room - no ice in the freezer and a slow running drain in the shower. We reported both issues and were offered a $50 deduction on our bill for the inconvenience, even though we weren't inconvenienced. As a matter of fact, when we realized there was no ice, we called room service and it was delivered within minutes.",July 2016

Lots of nearby high end shopping and restaurants.  The hotel part of the building goes up to the 26th floor with high end condos above the hotel.  We stayed in one of the luxury suites, which was very nice.  The living room is well away from the bedroom in case one of your wants to sleep late.  There is a nice balcony but its unfurnished.  The bed was just adequate - I didn't find it to be nearly as comfortable as some other reviewers.  Try to stay on one of the higher floors as the views are better. The second floor bar is small but very nice -- maybe 25 seats or so.  Bartenders are very friendly and mix great drinks.

The rooms were out of this world. I don't ever think I have seen a bathroom that nice. The Spa was amazing. The only thing that I didn't like was the $200 a day in authorizations per room.

Swimming pool and elevator were the bad parts of the stay.   Elevators were slow and kept requiring maintenance.  Swimming pool needs proper stairs.  It is a lap pool that requires you to climb down the wall with steps embedded in the wall.  It was very dangerous.  The food was good.  Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again.

I've tried to tip several employees and they really won't accept anything.  The restaurant is nicely done, and the bartender remembers my wife and I from previous visits.

Turns out amex books through orbitz through a third party credit card and pockets the difference. The staff was rude about it and when amex tried to rebook they wouldn't do it. We spent 200 dollars more for late check out . The staff claimed the room was going to be occupied when clearly no one checked in when we paid the extra money for late check out. It was 20 degrees out and I'm pregnant. The staff couldn't care less. This is not a Four Seasons or Peninsula when it comes to customer care.,December 2015

The room we were able to use had white stains on the valor love seat (disgustingly obvious as seaman). The lamps were also all titled as the top were clearly fixed in a rudimentary fashion. Most obviously was the dustiness of the room and the fact the ice box was at least 75 degrees and the attendant had to leave ice in a bucket due to the broken appliances. All of these issues were pointed out to the staff but they seemed more concerned about the returning guest's concerns and dismissed my concerns as simply unfortunate since we didn't complain or make a fuss.

The deep soaking tub with bath fizz tablets, marble shower, separate toilet, and yummy smelling Salvatore Ferragamo toiletries.    I ordered room service once and it was fast, Delicious and amazing!

It is not a huge hotel so it was easy in and out or on the elevator. Great fitness facility and steam/sauna. Indoor pool was great as well. They have a courtesy car for distances up to 2 miles - we asked about 6 times and it was never available - sound like you need to book in advance. Great bonus - but only if it is available. Their bar is nice, but quiet. It needs to be moved possibly to the main floor with some window exposure to liven it up. I will stay here again, I stay at many around the world and it is nice to see the brand is true wherever I go.",August 2015

I have stayed at the Langham in Chicago and the Jefferson in DC and can tell you that Waldorf Astoria Chicago pales in comparison. It took two calls (for which the phone rang endlessly) to get anything fixed. How do the doors being broken not make it on a check list? I hold out hope that other Waldorf Astoria's are not this bad. If you in Chicago however look elsewhere.,August 2015

Superbly located, beautifully decorated, clean and well maintained to the max! We were impressed with all their amenities from the large suite we were upgraded to with a fire place, bar and huge bathroom to the incredible spa and fitness facility - we could have moved in! The most impressive feature was the service, on our way out my husband tried to tip the bellman but he wouldn't accept, stating that it's all part of their service.. wow! Well done!

Tons of closet and drawers  2 balconies in a huge suite. Bathrooms to spread out all our beauty products. Bathrooms could have slightly brighter lighting as we all agreed. Breakfast was delicious and great service. Good location to walk anywhere in the city. It would have been nice to use the small lap pool without kids throwing footballs and perhaps management could suggest to parents when there are other adults in the pool to control the kids. Also I heard everyone complain about super slow elevators and I would tend to agree. Concierge was extremely kind and helpful  as well,August 2015

The rooms (especially the specialty suites, to which they have sometimes upgraded us) are as magnificent as you would expect from the jewel of the Hilton chain.  But one of the things I really appreciate most is that despite their no tipping policy (which the staff seems to take very seriously), every member of the staff is extraordinarily gracious and helpful.  And although I don't think I'm really Waldorf-Astoria material (I can only afford to stay using Hilton Honors points), we are always treated as though we are among their most special guests.  That's what I mean by ""unpretentious!.""  Another feature I really appreciate…",May 2015

The room was sound proof, so we couldn't hear any outside noise or neighbor noise.  The staff was incredibly polite and helpful (especially the concierge).  The bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was amazing.  We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel.  I don't typically spend a lot of money on hotels, but if I find myself in the Chicago area again, I would definitely be tempted to book another stay at the Waldorf.",August 2015

The luxury suite was also attractive but those extra elements that would make this a very special place are missing.  For example, no shower caps, microwave but no coffeemaker or silverware (unless you ask...which we found out two days into our stay), no turn down service, no video games for kids.  Requests are forgotten or very slowly executed.   Room service menu was very limited.  The no tip policy is nice.  The SPA was better than the hotel itself, relaxing and professional services.  I hate to say it but for a similar price the Trump Hotel suites are better as they offer a full apartment and they don't miss a beat on making you feel you are in a luxury hotel.",July 2015

The hotel is just not on the same level as the Trump hotel, so you do get what you pay for. There is no real wow factor to the room the same way you have it in the Trump with the amazing river views, but the room itself was quite nice and nothing to complain about.

Super nice rooms ( we had a suite with a fireplace and separate master suite). The hotel is located near the shopping and many things to do in Chicago. The only drawback was there was no real bar or restaurant in the day time so if you wanted a glass of wine or a sandwich you had to head out to find that but there is so much close by it was not a deal killer. The rooms had lovely plush furniture, marble baths and just totally glam :). Would stay here again for sure and don't forget to check out the spa area for complete pampering! They have sauna and steam rooms!",December 2014

At the outset, I must say that this stay was booked on frequent stay points, so we were not paying the market rate for our room. However, at no point did we get sub-par response in the service from the staff.  We are frequent visitors to Chicago as we have family on the outskirts, so we have visited a good number of hotels in the area, primarily for dining, so can't comment on the quality of the rooms, but to my mind, the Waldorf Astoria has got the mix between opulence and quality just right. There is no doubting that this is a top quality hotel, but is not done in an ""in your face"" manner, or over the top ""bling"" mode. The rooms are fantastic with great facilities, the hotel…",July 2015

We did hear hallway noise outside our room, so while the hotel is generally quiet, sound travels down the halls.  Elevators too slow.  Nice front desk service and well informed concierge.  The doormen do not accept tips, and we liked that -- tips of course are built into the price of the room.  Cozy little bar on the second floor. It's a fine hotel, very well appointed, and with very good service.  I would stay here again.",June 2015

We arrived at 9 at night and check in was easy and everyone was very polite.  They even handed both kids a toy walrus stuffed animal which was nice touch for 2 tired kids.  Our king suite was perfect and the best hotel I have stayed in with kids so far.  It was huge probably 700 square feet and had a large queen sofa bed for both kids.  We had a king bed and huge bathroom area.  Lots of drawer storage space, huge closets and lots of room to unpack.  A small balcony that you couldn't sit on but I guess nice to get fresh air.  We never heard one sound the entire stay from other rooms or from outside.  There was a small lap pool in the spa area but nice for the kids to…",July 2015

This was our first stay at the hotel--we usually stay at either the Four Seasons, the Ritz-Carlton or the Peninsula. Chicago hotels were busy, in part because the Grateful Dead were in town giving their final three concerts. The staff in the lobby was not particularly cordial, and the concierges especially seemed not to care for us at all. One was on the phone, and we waited 2-3 minutes before being told that he'd be with us in a couple of minutes. He seemed impatient with us for waiting—we left un-helped. Another seemed to be almost happy informing that he couldn't secure tickets for a venue like the institute of art.

We were immediately told upon arriving that they are a no tipping facility, and we found that to be so.    Once we arrived we were warmly greeted and checked in quickly even though we were a bit early.  Guess we hit them in a slower time as we were also able to extend our check out time a bit as well.

When there was a short wait for check in, we were asked if we would like water or needed help with anything. Our checkout was expedient and Wayne was fantastic.

They included a $60/day voucher that could be used against parking, restaurant, etc.  That saved us parking elsewhere in a dingy public parking lot, that we were not comfortable leaving our car at for the weekend.  The service was excellent, very fast.  Nice lap pool.  Great sauna and spa.  Rooms were huge, clean, and nicely decorated.  From our hotel you could walk to Gibson's Steakhouse, the Magnificent Mile, and even down to the river for a boat tour (maybe 20-25 mins walk).  Not sure about how long to walk to the zoo, but we drove and it was only 5 mins away.  Within 1-2 blocks there was Tempo Cafe (a super breakfast place), and Pizano's Pizza - both casual and delicious, with great service, not pricey.",June 2014

We live in the Chicago suburbs, too far to truly enjoy dinner in town and then face a long ride back, so the Waldorf is our go-to location for a treat.  We have literally changed weekend plans when we could not stay here.  I won't repeat the accolades about service, discretion, attentiveness, and quality that populate the other reviews - but I will echo them.  The staff is first rate and genuinely lovely.

The property is beautiful and well kept, most of the staff was helpful; however, there were just some setbacks during our stay that left a sour taste in our mouths. I think there are two points that will be important for fellow travelers from my experience:   1) If you have an issue during your stay, wait for the daytime manager to handle it. We were gently warned this by the night staff, but still requested to speak with the night manager and regret that decision. (I believe his name was Ron)  2) If there is a big price difference between the Waldorf and other top hotels, stay at the cheaper one.  The thing that distinguishes good hotels from great…",June 2014

The room was immaculate, clean, lots of storage.  The bathroom is spacious and gorgeous.  The manager sent us a bottle of champagne and macarons for our anniversary.

Everyone in our group (3 couples) was impressed: good value, extremely friendly and helpful staff (we almost felt like family), terrific room, bathroom, public spaces. Small things that added to our enjoyment were no-tipping policy and free WiFi: the aggravation of those ""nickel & dime"" charges at many nice hotels far exceeds the actual cost, but the Elysian was perfectly stress-free. The bar prices are pretty high, but not unexpected in Downtown Chicago.",August 2011

In the guestroom, there is nothing more you can ask for, comfortable bed, quality toiletry, and even a lint brush.

Better luxury options in Chicago,"Let me start off by saying this is a fine hotel and my rating is based on a comparison to other hotels at this price point.   My qualm with recommending this hotel lies in the price point. For the rack rate, better options abound in Chicago. This hotel just seems to be missing the small details that make a luxury hotel luxury. The hotel desperatley wants to be a luxury hotel, but I find their efforts wanting. I much prefer the understated and confident luxury of other well known luxury hotels in the city-especially those with a longer track record who have proven year after year to be able to meet the expectations of a decerning traveller.    There are two elevators servicing all floors, and they are s-l-o-w. I frequently waited upwards of 5-7 minutes per trip, and then had to…",January 2011

My only gripe is the bar on the first floor lacks any atmosphere. Whilst the service was great - the bar is like an after thought - very small and dark - I therefore chose to have a drink elsewhere. There is a bar in the restaurant - but it is a part of the restaurant.  Also, room service menu is very limited after 11.00pm. A simple request for a burger was met with ""we can't do that as it is after 11.00pm""   All being said - it is a great hotel - if it gets room service sorted out - it would be even better.",March 2011

I was developing a terrible cold when we arrived, but the easy check-in, the champagne split the manager sent to our room and the cozy warmth of the fireplace helped keep the cold at bay.  Although we couldn't enjoy the many facilities and services we had planned to, the location of the hotel made walking a simple exercise, even for somebody well under the weather.  About the only amenity I could have wished for, however, was an in-room coffee maker, just to get me on my feet.

The night before we were to leave, my husband became ill with a miserable cold and fever.  We decided to make the 2 1/2 hr drive anyway and were so pleasantly welcomed by gracious and unassuming staff.  They quickly checked us in, scheduled a spa apt for me while my husband slept and delivered a bottle of champagne to our room (which by the way was upgraded to a suite).  Their compassion and help were welcoming for a couple who were trying to ""get away"" for a fun weekend but broad sided with illness.

Curious as it was so close to my home 2 hours away, I inquired as to services on email and also called after shoveling through the giant snowstorm in the midwest of 2011.  Though in my eyes it was a very expensive price for a massage, my husband had a day off and I encouraged us to go for it! We have had massages here and there for about 25 years and could give and take them as they were only okay.  I knew in my heart I had never had a really good one and I had high hopes (really last hopes) for Elysian. Within 10 minutes of our arrival, I donned a luxurious robe and slippers, had a moment to explore an amazing eucalyptus steam room before entering a room to…",March 2011

The hotel is beautiful and has an excellent location - two minute walk from the Hancock tower, in the middle of the shopping area, yet not a noisy place at all, at least on a March weekend. The rooms are spacious and new, with beautiful marble bathrooms, spacious soaking tubs and glass showers. We stayed at a Gold Coast Suite for $500 a night which included brunch/breakfast every morning for two at their really nice restaurant and a bottle of champagne delivered to the room. Truthfully, we could have been fine with just a room vs. a suite, there was only the two of us and we never used the living room or the balcony. (I think the price for that with the same package would have been in 300s). Having learned it's my…",March 2011
