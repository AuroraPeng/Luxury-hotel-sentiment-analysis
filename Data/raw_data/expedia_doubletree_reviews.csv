I went and checked in as my husband parked the car, and we were allowed to leave the car there until 5 PM the next day. At the desk I was warmly greeted by Laura, given a quick review of the amenities available and were quickly and efficiently checked in.  Our room was lovely - nice space to relax on the sofa and had Coffee maker, safe, and ample closet area. The bathroom was clean and there were nice toiletries in eco-friendly containers in the shower area. We will stay there again certainly"

After checking out of the hotel, we were in a time crunch since we had a very early train ride back home. We unfortunately ran into some issues with getting an Uber/Lyft ride but Lawrence, who was working the front desk at the time, was quick and willing to help us problem-solve and was able to immediately call us a cab. If it weren‚Äôt for him, we would‚Äôve missed our train so we are especially thankful to him, as well as the Doubletree staff as a whole for an enjoyable stay! Would recommend!

My only complaints are the pillow quality is horrible. We were using 3 & 4 pillows per person. The pool was very nice but its marketed as having a pool bar. The bar is closed and looks to be used for storage. That was a definite negative. To get a drink or snacks you have to go all the way down to the lobby and the bar in the lobby doesn‚Äôt open until 4:00. Which was when we would leave the pool. Ended up going to the grocery store for our own drinks and snacks. Kind of a bummer.

My only complaints are the pillow quality is horrible. We were using 3 & 4 pillows per person. The pool was very nice but its marketed as having a pool bar. The bar is closed and looks to be used for storage. That was a definite negative. To get a drink or snacks you have to go all the way down to the lobby and the bar in the lobby doesn‚Äôt open until 4:00. Which was when we would leave the pool. Ended up going to the grocery store for our own drinks and snacks. Kind of a bummer.

197,2022-11-06 17:11:06.137784,4/5 Good,Christina,"Aug 25, 2022",,Stay was very nice. They texted me when my room was ready for an early checkin. The rooms were clean and the staff friendly. My only complaints are the pillow quality is horrible. We were using 3 & 4 pillows per person. The pool was very nice but its marketed as having a pool bar. The bar is closed and looks to be used for storage. That was a definite negative. To get a drink or snacks you have to go all the way down to the lobby and the bar in the lobby doesn‚Äôt open until 4:00. Which was when we would leave the pool. Ended up going to the grocery store for our own drinks and snacks. Kind of a bummer.

Lots of great restaurants in the area as well. Signature warm cookies were great (didn't get them at check in, had to request them)

Areas of opportunity:- Service was slow and lacking. Front desk agents were not very attentive or knowledgeable. Rooms were dated and dusty (hair and mold was in our bathroom before we touched or used anything). We actually asked the front desk to have housekeepiit off during the night. Someone asked about our stay at checkout and we told him about the above issues and instead of apologising or doing anything he was trying to sell us a package? Also, the safe/sanitized seal/sticker was not on the door when we reached our door. Didn't really see anyone really sanitising/cleaning highly touched areas except the bellman who sanitized his bell stand."

We paid good money to stay two nights and then to be charged $59 a night for parking. It was just honestly disappointing. That to me is a little much for when we are obviously paying to be at that hotel and already giving the hotel money. It made me bitter about other things which would never want me to stay there again. Sorry, great location but fix the parking fee and I‚Äôll come back and won‚Äôt mind the rotting bathroom cabinets that were painted over. That doesn‚Äôt bother me till when I then feel I should be having premium everything is paying so much in the end."

Lots of great restaurants in the area as well. Signature warm cookies were great (didn't get them at check in, had to request them)

Areas of opportunity:- Service was slow and lacking. Front desk agents were not very attentive or knowledgeable. Rooms were dated and dusty (hair and mold was in our bathroom before we touched or used anything). We actually asked the front desk to have housekeepiit off during the night. Someone asked about our stay at checkout and we told him about the above issues and instead of apologising or doing anything he was trying to sell us a package? Also, the safe/sanitized seal/sticker was not on the door when we reached our door. Didn't really see anyone really sanitising/cleaning highly touched areas except the bellman who sanitized his bell stand."

1095,2022-11-06 17:11:28.697553,3/5 Okay,Nada,"Jul 7, 2021",Horrible,To start the bathtub kept getting on clogging up every time the shower was turned on. So taking a shower wasn't possible and especially staying there for 3 days which was a disappointment we told a worker and her never showed up. We needed towels in our room and never got them so we ended up going again and asking around 1 pm and they told us there isn‚Äôt any available. Finally around 12:30 am we got a knock on our door and they gave us 4 small hand towels. Very disappointed with this trip and especially this being our first time there. Also when we went to the pool there weren‚Äôt any towels available. The lady said they were all used.

1099,2022-11-06 17:11:28.813536,1/5 Terrible,Verified traveler,"Jul 7, 2021",,"On word: cockroaches. Stay literally anywhere else. I stayed for two nights over the 4th of July weekend, and while the first night was okay, I came back to my room the second night and saw a cockroach crawling up my headboard. I immediately packed my stuff and checked out of the room. The overnight front desk person was nice and offered another room, but I knew I wouldn‚Äôt sleep. I ended up sleeping on a friend‚Äôs couch, and thank goodness I had local friends!!! That was the most major issue, but there were minor issues as well. First, there were no tongs with the ice pail, and despite calling and asking for some and being told some tongs were on the way, we never did get tongs. Okay, no big deal, I thought. I booked this place for the rooftop pool, and the pool itself is a lot of fun. Unfortunately, there are no rules about music, so multiple people were blasting competing, terrible music, and it definitely affected the vibe. We went out to the pool at around 1PM, and there were no towels. We asked for towels, and the staff person told us that the person who washes towels wouldn‚Äôt be in until 3PM. They did come back to the pool with about eight towels, but we only managed to get one to share for four people. When I called to get a refund for the second night, the person I spoke to was argumentative, impatient, and unhelpful. I had to call three times because she hung up after answering one question each time. I have to wait 3-5 business days to see if the refund, so we‚Äôll see"

Other than that, our stay was fantastic! The location kept everything in walking distance. I just had a hip replacement and I have some trouble walking, but the distances were not bad at all.
